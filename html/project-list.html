                <h4> Cascoda Ltd, Southampton (Internship)</h4>
                <h5> July to September 2016</h5>
                <p> Working together with another intern, we were tasked with creating a Unix based version of the Thread networking protocol from the OpenThread GitHub. We planned tasks jointly but work was split between us depending on our strengths and workload. By the end of the internship 6 Raspberry Pis were able to communicate autonomously with all of the OpenThread specifications met.</p>

                <p> Part time evening job whilst I was studying. Responsible for high standards of cleanliness in lecture theatres around the campuses. I had to work in an efficient and timely manner to clean the rooms, move furniture between rooms as required and reposting any faults within the rooms, including on each computer in the rooms.</p>

                <h4> 4th Year Group Project </h4>
                <p>My group  was tasked  with creating  an improvement for productivity in the workplace. An IoT device was created from scratch to be housed in the workplace to monitor the rooms  airflow, Co2 as well as humidity and Light. The device posted to a webpage to alert any users that the rooms conditions were not within the normal recommended bounds.</p>

                <h4>3rd Year Project</h4>
                <p>I created a cheap and easy to use Raspberry Pi based home security device that took audio and picture of an intruder within the monitored room using audio/motion sensing, and send them wirelessly to the users email for evidence as well as to alert the user</p>
